# RackNews

## Overview

**RackNews**, (possibly) the missing RackTables reports tool.

---
**RackNews** is a reporting tool for the datacenter inventory management system [RackTables](http://www.racktables.org). It allows objects in RackTables to be searhed, filtered, and displayed in a variety of formats, including JSON, ~~XML~~, and ~~HTML pages~~ (not yet).

### How to Use
#### Installation
To install, simply clone this repository/extract the archive into RackTables' **wwwroot**.

#### Operation
RackNews allows for use on the command line, through cURL/wget for scripts, as well as through a web interface. To access the web interface, simply visit \<RackTables root\>/racknews. You may be prompted to login; simply use your RackTables credentials. You should then see a form containing a table, a few textboxes, and a combo box for various parameters.
